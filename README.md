## üíº Internship Projects  

[**Oxleypawnshop Website**](https://oxleypawnshop.com)  
As a solo developer intern, I designed and launched a modern website for a Singapore-based pawnshop. The site features an interactive homepage with smooth animations, a contact form integrated with company email and automated replies, real-time gold price updates with fallback data sources, and fully configured company email accounts for all team members.  

[**Goldjewel Website**](https://goldjewel.sg) & [**CMS**](https://cms.goldjewel.sg)  
As a solo software engineer intern, I built and deployed a modern website for a jewelry business along with a custom content management system (CMS).

The CMS includes built-in image cropping tools and supports instant, real-time updates to the website whenever new products are added or existing ones are modified, ensuring a seamless workflow between product management and customer-facing updates.
